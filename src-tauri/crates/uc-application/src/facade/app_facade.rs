//! `AppFacade` — Slice 1 cross-domain aggregator.
//!
//! Per `uc-application/AGENTS.md` §11.4 external consumers reach the
//! application layer exclusively through a facade. `AppFacade` is the
//! single outward-facing type; internally it just groups sub-facades,
//! each constructed from its own `*Deps` bundle, so adding a new
//! domain does not cascade into a constructor explosion.
//!
//! # Current scope (Slice 1 · P4)
//!
//! * [`SpaceSetupFacade`] — A1 `initialize_space`, A2 `unlock_space`
//!
//! # Deferred
//!
//! * `PairingFacade` (B1 / B2) → P7+
//! * `SyncFacade` (C1 / C2 / C3) → Slice 2
//! * F1 `on_startup` / F2 `on_shutdown` → P6 (lives inside the
//!   sub-facades once `StartNetwork` plumbing exists)
//! * Daemon / tauri / CLI switching from the legacy sub-facades
//!   (`SetupFacade`, `PairingFacade`, `SpaceAccessFacade`) to
//!   `AppFacade` → Slice 1.5 or later. Those sub-facades remain `pub`
//!   this slice to keep existing entry points working.
