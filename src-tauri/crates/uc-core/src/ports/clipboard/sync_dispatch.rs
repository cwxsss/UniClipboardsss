//! Clipboard dispatch port (Slice 2 Phase 2).
//!
//! Replaces the frame-model [`ClipboardOutboundTransportPort`](super::transport)
//! with a business-semantic primitive: "send one clipboard entry's header +
//! ciphertext to one reachable peer, over a fresh stream". Multi-target
//! fan-out is assembled by `DispatchClipboardEntryUseCase` in
//! `uc-application`, not here, so the port stays minimal.
//!
//! The ciphertext is already V3-encoded + AEAD-sealed by the application
//! layer via `TransferCipherPort`; this port does not touch plaintext, nor
//! does it re-encrypt.
