//! `BlobTransferPort` — publish / fetch ciphertext + local reference

//!
//! Business model:
//!
//! * **Producer side** ([`BlobTransferPort::publish`] +
//!   [`BlobTransferPort::issue_ticket`]) — place a ciphertext in the local
//!   shareable store, receive a stable local identity ([`BlobDigest`]);
//!   mint an out-of-band retrieval credential ([`BlobTicket`]) when a peer
//!   needs to pull it.
//! * **Consumer side** ([`BlobTransferPort::digest_of`] +
//!   [`BlobTransferPort::fetch`]) — resolve a credential's content identity
//!   locally (skip the fetch when already held), otherwise retrieve the
//!   ciphertext via the credential's embedded sources.
//! * **Reference management** ([`BlobTransferPort::tag`] /
//!   [`BlobTransferPort::untag`] / [`BlobTransferPort::has`]) — declare /
//!   release that some business object holds a ciphertext, query whether
//!   the ciphertext is present locally. Reference *scanning* (GC) lives
//!   outside this port (see `task_plan.md §T-02`).
