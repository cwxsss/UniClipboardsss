//! Shared assembly of an outbound clipboard payload for the user/peer-initiated
//! send paths (resend + active-clipboard pull serve).
//!
//! Both paths run the identical "resolve file set → read metadata → plan →
//! publish blobs → build directory manifest → stamp identity → publish
//! oversized inline reps" sequence and differ only in how they map the failure
//! modes onto their own error surfaces. Keeping the sequence here (next to
//! [`resolve_outbound_file_set`]) prevents the parallel-logic drift that let
//! the pull-serve path leak flat directory frames in the first place (issue
//! #1327).
//!
//! The `dispatch_capture` path intentionally does NOT go through this helper:
//! its orchestration is genuinely different (LocalCapture origin gating,
//! per-phase latency instrumentation for GH#487, `Skipped { reason }`
//! outcomes), and folding it in would turn this into a leaky mega-helper.
