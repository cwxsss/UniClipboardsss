//! `ApplyInboundClipboardUseCase` — daemon-side inbound clipboard
//! processing pipeline (Slice 2 Phase 3 · T4).
//!
//! ## Flow
//!
//! 1. **Dedup short-circuit**: if `snapshot_hash` already exists in the
//!    local `clipboard_event` table as a *fully-held* entry, the payload is
//!    already ours — skip the download and the duplicate row, but still
//!    **re-activate** it (`Resurfaced`): rebuild the snapshot from the local
//!    entry, write it to the OS clipboard, advance the register, and bump it
//!    to the top of history. "This content exists in history" is not the same
//!    claim as "the OS clipboard currently holds it": a peer re-copying an
//!    older clip (A → B → A) must still land on the user's pasteboard.
//!    Genuinely redundant deliveries — a re-push inside the sub-second
//!    [`timing`] windows, or a partial superseding a partial — stay
//!    `DuplicateSkipped` (no OS write).
//! 2. **Envelope decode**: V3 → `SystemClipboardSnapshot`. Decode failure
//!    is non-fatal (`DecodeFailed` outcome) — corrupted payloads from a
//!    misbehaving peer don't crash the daemon's ingest loop.
//! 3. **Capture pipeline**: reuse `CaptureClipboardUseCase` with origin
//!    `RemotePush` so the entry, event, normalised representations,
//!    cache, spool, and (optional) search index all match the local
//!    capture path's schema (D5 decision).
//! 4. **OS clipboard write**: via `ClipboardWriteCoordinator` with
//!    `RemotePush` intent — arms a self-write echo record (a content hash
//!    guard plus a one-shot next-origin override, under the coordinator's echo
//!    budget) so the daemon's own clipboard watcher doesn't re-dispatch the
//!    just-written content (write-back loop defence; distinct from the inbound
//!    idempotency dedup in [`timing`]).
//!    The **full** snapshot (every V3-decoded representation) is handed
//!    to the coordinator; the platform layer internally decides whether
//!    to atomically write multiple formats (Windows today) or to narrow
//!    to the paste-priority rep via `SelectRepresentationPolicyV1`
//!    (macOS / Linux fallback today).
//!
//! Step ordering (3 → 4) matters: capture commits the event before the
//! OS write fires, so when the watcher consumes the origin guard it
//! already sees the persisted row.
//!
//! ## 模块拆分
//!
//! 这个模块按职责再细分到三个子文件,顶层 `mod.rs` 只持有公共类型
//! (`ApplyInboundInput` / `ApplyOutcome` / `ApplyInboundError`) 与 re-export:
//!
//! * [`ports`] — `InboundCapture` / `InboundWrite` 抽象 + 它们对
//!   `CaptureClipboardUseCase` / `ClipboardWriteCoordinator` 的 blanket impl,
//!   保持 use case 在测试里可 mock。
//! * [`materializer`] — `InboundBlobMaterializer` / `InboundBlobFetcher`
//!   抽象 + `FileCacheBlobMaterializer` 默认实现,负责把入站 blob refs 拉到
//!   本机缓存 / 写回 representation。
//! * [`usecase`] — `ApplyInboundClipboardUseCase` 主流程,只负责编排:
//!   dedup → V3 解码 → emit IncomingPending → materialize → capture → OS write。
//!
//! ## Testability
//!
//! `CaptureClipboardUseCase` and `ClipboardWriteCoordinator` are
//! concrete structs with 7+2 port dependencies. Holding them as
//! `Arc<dyn Trait>` via two thin internal abstractions
//! ([`InboundCapture`] / [`InboundWrite`]) keeps the use case mockable
//! without requiring tests to construct full real implementations.
//! Production wires the concrete types via the blanket impls in
//! [`ports`].
